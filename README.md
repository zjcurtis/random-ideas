All the projects I think ought to be done. Maybe. Some day?

## Distributed Supercompilation
What would the world be like if *X compiler* could work as a distributed supercompiler? I think that'd be neat, and maybe we'd get faster/better programs. 

## Relational OS
In a lot of ways relational/logic languages could be really good for low level stuff, see Hoare Logic. What would that look like? 

## Global, Deniable, Multi-Channel Communication Network
The problem with encryption is it can be suspicious, and it often doesn't really hide who you're talking to, or how the message got routed. "We kill people using metadata"... So to some extent it seems like the idea communication is one that cannot be proved to have happened. Some variant of steganography seems like the ticket, maybe it's impossible, certainly couldn't be used for everything (we need a 'normal' thing to hide our code in) but *shrug* I'd like to see it explored.
